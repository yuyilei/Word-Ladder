 A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one
letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters
still forms a valid word. For example, here is a word ladder connecting the word
"code" to the word "data". Each changed letter is underlined as an illustration:

code → cade → cate → date → data
